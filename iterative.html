                            This was an interesting exercise in design where we created a redesign of a webpage... 
                            without ever looking at the original webpage! Given a couple startups with an accompanying
                            description, we chose Buy Me a Coffee, which was described as "a platform for creators to receive
                            monetary support from their fans." Basically, you can think of it as Patreon v2.0 with a focus on 
                            microtransactions.

                            The initial sketches were created by the lovely Julie Wang, who made 4 sets 
                            of conceptual sketches.

                        <div class = "summary">
                            After discussing each design, we decided to go with sketch #1 because the home page 
                            best represented the diverse target audiences of users (artists, podcasters, educators), 
                            while the profile page enabled the user to engage with their fans through posts and a 
                            gallery of their content.  </div>

                         <div class = "summary">
                            We ruled out Sketch #2 and #4 because they both attempted to recommend personal suggestions to users,
                            which conflicts with the original goal of the startup. Buy Me a Coffee is not a platform for user 
                            entertainment, but a platform for charitable donations. 
                            Additionally, a recommendation system could negatively affect the customer base, as creators have to feel 
                            incentivized that their profiles might actually be seen. In that sense, sketch #1 allows diverse categories of creators 
                            to be presented without algorithmic bias, allowing more fairness in terms of what is advertised!

                            Meanwhile, we also ruled out sketch #3 because we thought the emphasis on
                             monetary statistics was too heavy for a the landing page.

                            This was the fun part! The first thing we did to get a feel for our design was
                            create a style sheet, which looks like this:
                        </div>

                            This was actually Julie and Katherine's idea. I had never thought about making 
                            a style sheet before prototyping, and after doing so I highly recommend it! 
                            This was another opportunity to learn from the practices of other designers.

                            For our font combination, we picked Quattrocentro Sans (sans serif) and Zilla Slab (slab serif),
                             as they make a playful,  light impression. 
                            For our color palette, we were coffee inspired (black, white, brown), with
                            some pastels thrown in for accents.

                            We also decided that we wanted to include illustrations to represent different 
                            tiers of donation. So, for example, $1 might be a coffee icon, while $10 might be 
                            a cake. I had the pleasure of making the illustrations in Adobe Illustrator!

                            We represented the donation tiers as food because showing the donors that they are buying
                            the creator a concrete item (i.e. a sandwich for lunch) encourages empathy and helps donors 
                            conceptualize the financial impact of their donation.

                            The gift box is the odd one out, but there's a reason for that— it represents 
                            a custom donation that the donor can choose.

                            Julie, Katherine, and I created the high fidelity mockups in Figma. We prioritized a 
                            minimalistic design and tried to ensure that a user would not be confused by our layout.

                            After creating our initial mockup, we presented our design to other students at Brown to receive 
                            critical feedback that we could use to improve our design. One of the suggestions 
                            was to show the name and profile of the creator you are donating to
                            so contributors 1) can easily confirm they are indeed donating to the right person, 
                            and 2) invoke empathy by reminding them they are contributing to the livelihood of 
                            one of their favorite creators. We really liked this idea, so we went back and changed 
                            our prototype to involve the user profile throughout the donation process!

                            We honestly didn't do a lot of user testing, but we did get feedback from 3 users on UserTesting.com. 
                            In general, there didn't seem to be much confusion about how to use the website, but some of the tasks 
                            took longer than they ideally should have. We think these results were slightly skewed because 
                            there were some technical issues where two of the users were 
                            not able to scroll, likely causing the task execution time to increase. We weren't able to resolve the issue 
                            as we could not figure out if this was occuring on UserTesting.com's end or Figma's end, so we had to roll 
                            with these results.

                            Thankfully, two of the users gave us high ratings of 9 and 10, so we were very happy with that! Ideally, we would 
                            do more user testing if this was a real, deployable user application, but we got a little taste
                            of what it would be like to do UI/UX research through this process.
