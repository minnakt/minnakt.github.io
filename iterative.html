                            This was an interesting exercise in design where we created a redesign of a webpage... 
                            without ever looking at the original webpage! Given a couple startups with an accompanying
                            description, we chose Buy Me a Coffee, which was described as "a platform for creators to receive
                            monetary support from their fans." Basically, you can think of it as Patreon v2.0.

                            The initial sketches were created by the lovely Julie Wang, who made 4 sets 
                            of sketches, receiving our feedback every time.

                            We decided to go with sketch1 because the home page 
                            best represented the diverse target audiences of users (artists, podcasters, educators), 
                            while the profile page enabled the user to engage with its fans through posts and a 
                            gallery of their content.  </div>

                            Sketch #2 and #4 attempted to recommend personal suggestions to users, but we realized
                            that Buy Me a Coffee was not created for user entertainment, as it's a donation 
                            platform, and to bring in a larger customer base, creators have to feel 
                            incentivized that their profiles might actually be seen. In the end, we went 
                            with sketch #1 because it allowed the diverse 
                            categories of creators to be presented in a more neutrally without algorithmic bias, 
                            allowing more fairness in terms of what is advertised!

                            This was the fun part! The first thing we did to get a feel for our design was
                            create a style sheet, which looks like this:
                        </div>

                            This was actually Julie and Katherine's idea. I had never thought about making 
                            a style sheet before prototyping, and after doing it I highly recommend it to
                            everyone! I'm always grateful for what I learn from other designers.

                            For our font combination, we picked Quattrocentro Sans (sans serif) and Zilla Slab (slab serif) 
                            as our fonts, as they make a playful,  light impression. 
                            For our color palette, we were coffee inspired (black, white, brown), with
                            some pastels thrown in for accents.

                            We also decided that we wanted to include illustrations to represent different 
                            tiers of donation. So, for example $1 might be a coffee icon, while $10 might be 
                            a cake. I had the pleasure of making the illustrations!

                            increase the donations user's receive. Showing the donors that they are buying
                            the creator a sandwich (i.e. lunch) encourages empathy and helps donors 
                            conceptualize the financial impact of their donation.

                            Once we finished our prototype, Dain posted it on UserTesting.com, where three users were instructed
                            to complete the task "Donate one coffee to Jeff Huang." In general, users were able 
                            to complete our tasks quickly. We discovered through feedback that there were some issues 
                            with scrolling on the page, which likely causes the tasks to take longer than they should
                            have.

                            There was also some confusion about the task of donating because there are several 
                            screens before the donation is finalized. We could likely cut down on the number of
                            confirmation quicks to streamline this process.
