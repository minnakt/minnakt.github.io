                                Meet our client, Dr. Nicholas Grumbach! <br/>
                                Dr. Grumbach is a pediatrician who sees 
                                patients at the Medicine-Pediatrics Primary Care Center as a member of the Brown faculty. 
                                He came to us looking for an application that would encourage compliance among children—
                                that is, he wanted to find a way to encourage children with long-term medical conditions 
                                (such as asthma) to take their prescribed medication.
                            </div>

                            The team consisted of:

                                    <li> Me (Brown) — full-stack developer, illustrator </li>

                            Dr. Grumbach had actually worked on this idea beforehand, so he came to us with a couple
                            of screens, which I share below:
                        </div>

                        <div class = "summary">
                           Our team agreed with the first and second screens in that we needed to keep a list of the user's medications,
                           and also keep track of their reward. However, we strongly disagreed with the third screen that
                           displays a ranking of who was most "compliant." We didn't believe that health should become a 
                           competition. When we communicated this to Dr. Grumbach, he agreed that
                           the feature would not be necessary.

                            Before designing our application, we conducted user research to gain insight 
                            into how this app would be used. We interviewed 2 parents with children and 3 
                            pediatricians living locally in Rhode Island. The interviews occurred over
                            the phone and were semi-structured, each lasting about 25 minutes.

                                It was often hard for parents to deal with children who didn't like taking their
                                medication.
                            </li>

                                Children are hard to motivate when they don't understand the long-term benefit
                                of their actions.
                            </li>

                                Many of Dr. Grumbach's patients come from low-income family and use their phones
                                as their computers.

                            We then constructed a list of necessary specifications for our application:

                                There needs to be a rewards system to motivate the children.

                            <li>
                                Every user needs to have their own account so that they can look at their
                                personal medication. This information needs to be handled carefully because
                                medical information is sensitive.
                            </li>

                                The app should be optimized for mobile use.

                            <li>
                                It should be easy to use for children, parents, & doctors who all interact with
                                the app in some way.

                            This project was bigger than we all expected it to be, especially because 
                            of the complicated logic in keeping track of the days that users have to 
                            take medication, how many days they have completed, and what medications they
                            have already fulfilled for the day. Because we were also in a rush for the
                            final deadline, it resulted in not exactly the cleanest
                            code, so I would like go back one day and fix it up!

                            Though this was not built for a user interface design course, I particularly
                            realized the important of UI. A couple days before the due date I was incredibly
                            unsatisfied with our app, although it was completely functional. Catherine, our
                            team designer, spent the night beautifying the website and voila! I loved it
                            instantly.
