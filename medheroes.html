                                Dr. Grumbach is a pediatrician who sees 
                                patients at the Medicine-Pediatrics Primary Care Center as a member of the Brown faculty. 
                                He came to us looking for an application that would encourage compliance among children—
                                that is, he wanted to find a way to encourage children with long-term medical conditions 
                                (such as asthma) to take their prescribed medication.

                            Dr. Grumbach had actually worked on this idea beforehand when he participated in a 
                            healthcare hackathon. He came to us with a couple of screens worked out, which I share below:

                        <div class = "summary">
                           These examples helped our team understand exactly what Dr. Grumbach wanted— a child-friendly theme,
                           a motivation system, and a way to keep track of progress. We recognized that the UI would need a 
                           serious update to be comparable to modern app designs, but this laid the groundwork for our 
                           future design iterations.

                            One thing we removed from the demo almost immediately was the third screen which displays a 
                            ranking of the most "compliant" users. After some discussion, none of us believe that the app should 
                            advocate for health as a competition. When we communicated this to Dr. Grumbach, he agreed that
                            the feature would not be necessary.

                            Before designing our application, we conducted user research to gain insight 
                            into how this app would be used. We interviewed 2 parents with children and 3 
                            pediatricians living locally in Rhode Island. The interviews occurred over
                            the phone and were semi-structured, each lasting about 25 minutes.

                                personal medication. This information needs to be handled carefully because
                                medical information is sensitive.

                            This project was bigger than we all expected it to be, especially because 
                            of the complicated logic in keeping track of the days that users have to 
                            take medication, how many days they have completed, and what medications they
                            have already fulfilled for the day. The back-end ended up being fairly 
                            complicated, and being the only back-end programmer on the team, it was tough but 
                            I learned a lot.

                            We were actually in quite a rush to reach the deadline, so the final UI only shaped 
                            up around 5 days before. At the time Catherine was working super hard to beautify the 
                            UI with her wicked CSS skills.

                            This project probably caused me the most stress I have ever had in my life, 
                            but it was incredibly rewarding. I felt myself grow as a programmer, a designer, 
                            and an illustrator all at the same time— in fact, this was the semester where 
                            I learned Adobe Illustrator one painful night at 2am! (Though it wasn't awesome 
                            at the time, I am extremely grateful I did that.)

                            Some things to explore in the future are further development (for example, improving
                            the calendar such that it explicitly says what medicine has been taken on what day)
                            and more user testing (never enough of that). Overall, a great project, and a concrete 
                            time in my life where I was growing every single day.
