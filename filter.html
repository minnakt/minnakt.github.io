                            With so much content and information available on modern websites, 
                            live filtering has become a powerful feature to help users immediately 
                            find what they seek. A good filtering system combined with a good UI can 
                            improve user experience not only by allowing users to avoid the frustration of clutter, 
                            but by giving them a way to seamlessly navigate your website.

                            The goal of this project was to help Animal Crossing fans like me find and save their favorite

                            I used Python's <span class="bold">BeautifulSoup</span> library to web scrape for Animal Crossing villager data,
                            which included animal type, gender, personality, birthday, and catchphrase.

                            having to scrape and synthesize data from 4 different sources. Fortunately, now anyone who
                            wants to use my application will have the convenience of being able to view villager data

                            included 6 fields‚Äî image, name, gender, catchphrase, personality, and birthday.
                            The question was, how could I best display this information such that it would be easy for a user to parse?

                                    Another main focus for this project was the sidebar containing the filtering options.
                                    I wanted to make sure it could streamline user experience, and be intuitive enough
                                    to not require any further explanation.

                                    For the sidebar, I labeled the categories with underlined, bold green text 
                                    and used subtle grey horizontal lines to indicate separate functionality
                                    between Filter, Sort, and Favorites.

                                    Additionally, I made sure that the sidebar was sticky and would 
                                    follow the user as they scrolled. It would probably be very annoying for a 
                                    user to have to constantly scroll all the way up to change the 
                                    fields that they filtered and sorted on. Ensuring that this functionality 
                                    is available wherever the user is on the page makes for a much less 
                                    frustrating experience!

                            I chose a grid because the uniformity of it helps users parse information more
