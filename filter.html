                            With so much content and information available on modern websites, 
                            live filtering has become a powerful feature to help users immediately 
                            find what they seek. A good filtering system combined with a good UI can 
                            improve user experience not only by allowing users to avoid the frustration of clutter, 
                            but by giving them a way to seamlessly navigate your website.

                            As an exploration of filtering systems, I built a database of Animal Crossing characters (those
                            cute little Nintendo animals) that supports live filtering and sorting.
                            I wanted to help Animal Crossing fans find and save their favorite
                            characters!

                            I used Python's <span class="bold">BeautifulSoup</span> to web scrape for Animal Crossing villager data,
                            which included animal type, gender, personality, birthday, and catchphrase.

                            I couldn't find all of the information that I wanted to collect on a single website, so I ended up 
                            having to scrape and synthesize data from 4 different sources. Fortunately, now anyone who
                            wants to use my application will have the convenience of being able to view villager data
                            in one place.

                            I stuck to a minimalistic design with ample whitespace, since there are already
                            a lot of elements (over 100 villagers!) on the screen.
                            Using a grid, each villager is displayed as a uniform card such that the information 
                            is easy to parse.

                                    My main focus for this project was the sidebar containing the filtering options.
                                    I wanted to make sure it could streamline user experience, and be intuitive enough
                                    to not require any further explanation.

                                    For the sidebar, I labeled the categories  with underlined, bold green text 
                                    and used subtle grey horizontal lines to indicate separate functionality.

                                    Additionally, I made sure that the sidebar was sticky and would 
                                    follow the user as they scrolled. It would probably be very annoying for a 
                                    user to have to constantly scroll all the way up to change the 
                                    fields that they filtered and sorted on. Ensuring that this functionality 
                                    is available wherever the user is on the page makes for a much less 
                                    frustrating experience!

                            I loved working on this project, and it was a pleasant intersection between my affinity for 
                            cute video games and web apps! There are a couple things I could polish however, before I 
                            consider this a finished work.

                            Currently, my application doesn't allow you to filter for multiple things on a single field.
                            So for example, say you want to filter for both the "Peppy" and "Jock" personalities. This
                            cannot be doneâ€” you can only filter for one at a time. If I wanted to implement this I'd 
                            probably have to change the dropdowns, since dropdowns imply a single choice!

                            Additionally, my application relies on third party image links. This is quite bad especially
                            if those websites go poof. ðŸ’¥
                            I would need to download the image files using a Python script, then host them somewhere (either
                            on my server or on a database like MongoDB).
