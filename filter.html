                            With so much content and information available on modern websites, 
                            live filtering has become a powerful feature to help users immediately 
                            find what they seek. A good filtering system combined with a good UI can 
                            improve user experience not only by allowing users to avoid the frustration of clutter, 
                            but by giving them a way to seamlessly navigate your website.

                            As an exploration of filtering systems, I built a database of Animal Crossing characters— those
                            cute little Nintendo animals— that supports live filtering and sorting.
                            The goal of this project was to help Animal Crossing fans like me find and save their favorite
                            characters!

                            Before anything, I had to get my data. I used Python's <span class="bold">BeautifulSoup</span> library to web scrape for Animal Crossing villager data,
                            which included animal type, gender, personality, birthday, and catchphrase.

                            having to scrape and synthesize data from 4 different sources. Fortunately, now anyone who
                            wants to use my application will have the convenience of being able to view villager data

                            It was important for me to be able to communicate the information associated to each
                            villager in a concise, clean way. The information I had to display on the villager cards 
                            included 6 fields— image, name, gender, catchphrase, personality, and birthday.
                            How could I best display this information such that it would be easy for a user to parse?

                            To answer this question, I created 3 different card designs in Figma, and evaluated them.
                            You can see the three designs below:

                            Here's how I evaluated them:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Design #1: Too much contrast between the bold and standard fonts. 
                                It overlabels, when a defined layout would not 
                                need any labels in the first place.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Design #2: It's fine, but too much of the text is consolidated at the 
                                bottom of the card, making it a little uncomfortable to look at.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Design #3: The distribution of the text is much better, but the personality 
                                label looks out of place. It would look better with the same personality label 
                                as design #2.
                            </li>

                                    My main focus for this project was the sidebar containing the filtering options.
                                    I wanted to make sure it could streamline user experience, and be intuitive enough
                                    to not require any further explanation.

                                    For the sidebar, I labeled the categories  with underlined, bold green text 
                                    and used subtle grey horizontal lines to indicate separate functionality.

                                    Additionally, I made sure that the sidebar was sticky and would 
                                    follow the user as they scrolled. It would probably be very annoying for a 
                                    user to have to constantly scroll all the way up to change the 
                                    fields that they filtered and sorted on. Ensuring that this functionality 
                                    is available wherever the user is on the page makes for a much less 
                                    frustrating experience!

                            I chose a grid because the uniformity of it helps users parse information more

                            celebrates villager birthdays, so this feature is handy!
                            Lastly, you also have the option of favoriting villagers by clicking 
                            the little heart in the corner of the card.

                            So for example, say you want to filter for both the "Peppy" and "Jock" personalities. This
                            cannot be done— you can only filter one at a time. If I wanted to implement this I'd 
                             have to change the dropdowns, since dropdowns imply a single choice!

                            To remedy this, I would need to download the image files using a Python script, then host them somewhere (either
