                            if you've been on my page for a little while you might have noticed that 
                            I really like emojis. Emojis have become a staple of modern conversation that 
                            transcends languages, used all over the world.

                            HappySadSleepyMad was a semester-long project for Brown's "Data Science" course.
                            Our goal was not to merely compare the meaning of emojis across different 
                            languages— because let's face it, 😀 probably means the same thing around the 
                            world— but to detect the nuances in emoji usage.

                        <div class = "summary">
                            Our team consisted of 4 people, each of us representing one emoji in the project name!

                                    <li> Katherine Sang — 😊 </li>

                            Data collection was probably the most important part of the project, because it forms
                            the foundation for everything that follows. Though we originally planned to scrape
                            from multiple sources such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, we quickly learned that
                            Facebook has strict restrictions on their data policy which ruled Facebook and Instagram out.

                            In the end, we settled for Twitter, which, by the way, also required us to request an API key,
                            and we failed to receive a response for the entire semester. We ended up acquiring an API key through
                            some less-than-scrupulous methods... but we had good intentions!

                        <div class = "summary">
                            We scraped Twitter for tweets containing emojis for one month from March to April, collecting nearly 300,000 tweets 
                            during that time. We then inserted our data into a SQLite DB, and it looked a little like this:

                            As you can see, we collected information such as username, region, sentiment, and iteraction 
                            counts. You can also see that the data is not exactly clean because not every Twitter user utilizes 
                            geo-tagging... so we also had to deal with that. 😅

                           and neutral.

                           Following sentiment analysis, we performed case studies of context analysis on English, Japanese, and Spanish. 
                           These languages were simply the languages for which we had collected the most tweet data!

                            To clarify, context analysis is when you find what words are used in similar contexts. Note that this is slightly different 
                            from synonyms, although synonyms would definitely be used in very similar contexts. For example, if you have the 
                            sentences "Mary walks to the bedroom" and "John goes to the bathroom," then "Mary" and "John" are words 
                            used in similar contexts, but they aren't synonyms.

                            We used our tweet data to construct sparse word vectors, which we then used to discover words that were

                            context for each emoji in 😊😢😴😤. Once we had the most similar words for every emoji, we created radial graphs 
                            using Javascript's D3 library.

                            The distance between the words and the emoji in the center represents the cosine similarity of contexts.

                            This was one of my first long-term project based classes at Brown, and it was a really 
                            rewarding experience! It was perfect intersection between data and design and if I could
                            I would do it all over again.

                            Had we had more time, we would have liked to create a Deep Learning model that could 
                            predict the emojis from the text of a tweet. We did attempt this with KNN, SVM, &
                            DecisionTree, but the models had at most an accuracy of 3 percent— pretty terrible. 
                            Deep Learning is in itself a different field, but it would be fun to see where this 
                            could take us!
